<h1>QUACKE</h1>
<p>It's going to be a Quake like game (once in the future :D). It's written in C++ with OpenGL 3.3 for graphics, Bullet3 for physics simulation and imgui for developer ui.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>It's only purpose is learning. I want to be a game developer and I want to improve myself as a programmer, so I started to make this without a game engine.</p>
<h2>Features which are currently in</h2>
<p>The project contains several thing:</p>
<lu>
  <li>

  <li>
    Static and dynamic enviroment entities
  </li>
  <li>
    Character controller: this is for "living" entities
  </li>
  <li>
    It supports wavefront objects either
  </li>
  <li>
    Has a basic performance profiler which writes out FPS, and process time in ms for each main segment.
  </li>
